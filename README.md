# DataProfessionalAnalysis_PowerBi_Dashboard
The "Data Professional Survey Dashboard" project, inspired by Alex-the-Analyst, emphasizes using PowerQuery Editor to clean and organize real-world raw data.

**Challenges Faced:**
Data Structuring: The dataset included a wide variety of job roles within the data profession. I streamlined this by grouping less common roles under "Other" using Power Query Editor.
Salary Data Transformation: The yearly salary data was initially presented in ranges (e.g., 30k-40k). I split these into two separate columns and calculated the average to generate a more consistent metric.

**Key Learnings:**
Gained insights into different strategies for data cleaning and transformation.
Identified the appropriate visualization tools.

**Key Insights:**
Data scientists tend to have the highest salaries, followed by data engineers and data architects.
The USA boasts the highest average salaries, while India has the lowest. However, salary structures are closely tied to the cost of living in each country. 
Notably, 95% of respondents from Canada reported data-related roles.
Despite the high salaries, data professionals often seem less satisfied with their compensation.
